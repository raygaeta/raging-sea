# Creative Coding Challenge: Perlin Wave Shader ðŸŒŠ


### This challenge explores the beauty of procedural art through a wave-like material crafted with Perlin noise. A wave like custom shader material made with a perlin noise function. Careful attention went into vertex elevation to create a color gradient  according to Y. The effect is accentuated with custom lighting which required me to compute normals. 

## Features
#### Dynamic Vertex Elevation: Elevates vertices based on Perlin noise to form an undulating wave effect. The elevation drives a stunning gradient tied to the Y-axis, creating vibrant, flowing colors.
#### Custom Lighting: Achieves a polished and immersive look with hand-computed normals, ensuring realistic lighting and depth.
Art Meets Performance: Optimized for real-time rendering, perfect for interactive visuals or digital art installations.

## Tech Stack
