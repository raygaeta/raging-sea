# Creative Coding Challenge: Perlin Wave Shader ðŸŒŠ

#### This project explores procedural art through a wave-like material crafted with Perlin noise. By focusing on dynamic vertex elevation and custom lighting, this shader-based creation blends art and technology, delivering an immersive visual experience. 

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### ðŸŒŠ Dynamic Vertex Elevation
#### Elevates vertices using Perlin noise to create a mesmerizing wave effect. The elevation drives a vibrant color gradient tied to the Y-axis, resulting in flowing, lifelike visuals.

### ðŸ’¡ Custom Lighting
#### Computes normals manually to ensure realistic lighting and depth, adding a polished and immersive aesthetic to the waves.

### ðŸŽ¨ Art Meets Performance
#### Optimized for real-time rendering, making it ideal for interactive visuals, digital art installations, or creative experiments.
